This is the theme server running on http://jsonresume.org/themes.

## Themes

All themes must follow the naming convention:  
`jsonresume-theme-<name>`, where `<name>` is your custom theme name.

Example:  
__Boilerplate theme__
- [GitHub](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate)
- [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate)

## Theme registry

After a theme has been published to npm, you can browse the theme here:  
http://themes.jsonresume.org/flat

You can also choose specific theme versions, like this:  
http://themes.jsonresume.org/flat@0.3.2

__As soon as you publish to npm, the registry will automatically start using the latest version.__

Browse [available themes](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=jsonresume-theme-*).
